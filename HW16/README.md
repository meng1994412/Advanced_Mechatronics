## HW16: Motor Control
### Objectives:
* Make PI controller for wheel velocity.

### Approaches:
* PIC32 Program Code instructions (all are under `PIC32Program/firmware/src/` ):
  - `app.h` & `app.c` (combine with `system_interrupt.c` under `system_config/default/`): PI controller for wheel velocity and steering.
  - `main.c`: main function that controls `app.c`.
